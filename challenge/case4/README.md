# Jasmine Astrometry Challenge
## Case 4
The data of the astrometry challenge Case 4: In this challenge, the telescope is affected by distortion. Astronomical sources are fetched from the Gaia EDR3 catalog. The observation fields are around the Galactic center. Each field contains about 500 sources. A list of source positions on the focal plane and original ICRS coordinates is provided. Solve the field and the distortion parameters. Solve the field center and the position angle. The answers are found as keywords in the meta section in the tables.
