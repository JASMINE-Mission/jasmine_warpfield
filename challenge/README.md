# Jasmine Astrometry Challenge

This directory contains data tables for astrometry exercises. In the JASMINE project, the distortion of optics should be evaluated on the spot. The tables below provide practices to solve fields and constrain distortion parameters. Source positions on the focal plane are listed in the table. Some positions suffer from distortion. In the first release, 5 cases are prepared. The data tables are given in the [IPAC][IPAC] format.

## Case 1
The data of the astrometry challenge Case-1: The telescope is set distortion-free. Astronomical sources are retrieved from the Gaia EDR3 catalog. A list of the source positions on the focal plane and the ICRS coordinates is provided. Solve the field center and the position angle. The answers are found as keywords in the meta section in the tables.

## Case 2
The data of the astrometry challenge Case-2: The telescope is set distortion-free. Astronomical sources are retrieved from the Gaia EDR3 catalog. A list of source positions on the focal plane is provided, while the corresponding stellar coordinates are not provided. Instead, a list of the coordinates is given as a separate file. Solve the field center and the position angle. The answers are found as keywords in the meta section in the tables.

## Case 3
The data of the astrometry challenge Case 3: In this challenge, the telescope is affected by distortion. Artificial sources tiled in a grid pattern are generated. A list of source positions on the focal plane and original ICRS coordinates is provided. Solve the position angle and distortion parameters. Solve the field and the distortion parameters. The answers are found as keywords in the meta section in the tables.

## Case 4
The data of the astrometry challenge Case 4: In this challenge, the telescope is affected by distortion. Astronomical sources are fetched from the Gaia EDR3 catalog. The observation fields are around the Galactic center. Each field contains about 500 sources. A list of source positions on the focal plane and original ICRS coordinates is provided. Solve the field and the distortion parameters. Solve the field center and the position angle. The answers are found as keywords in the meta section in the tables.

## Case 5
The data of the astrometry challenge Case 5: In this challenge, the telescope is affected by distortion. Astronomical sources are fetched from the Gaia EDR3 catalog. The observation fields are randomly selected from the sky. The number of sources in each exposure is smaller than in Case-4. A list of source positions on the focal plane and original ICRS coordinates is provided. Solve the field and the distortion parameters. The field parameters are available in separate tables. The distortion parameters are found as keywords in the meta section in the tables.
