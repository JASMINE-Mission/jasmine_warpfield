# Jasmine Astrometry Challenge

This directory contains data tables for astrometry exercises. In the JASMINE project, the distortion of optics should be evaluated on the spot. The tables below provide practices to solve fields and constrain distortion parameters. Source positions on the focal plane are listed in the table. Some positions suffer from distortion. In the first release, 5 cases are prepared. The data tables are given in the [IPAC][IPAC] format.

|Case  |Description|
|------|:----------|
|Case 1|Solve the field (pointing center and position angle).|
|Case 2|Identify the sources from the source catalog.|
|Case 3|Solve the field and distortion using grid sources.|
|Case 4|Solve the field and distortion using astronomical sources.|
|Case 5|Solve the field and distortion using multiple frames.|
|Case 6|Solve the fields without absolute stellar positions.|
|Case 7|Solve the fields and (SIP) distortion without absolute stellar positions.|
|Case 8|Solve the fields and general distortion without absolute stellar positions.|
