# Jasmine Astrometry Challenge


## Case 1
The data of the astrometry challenge Case-1: The telescope is set distortion-free. Astronomical sources are retrieved from the Gaia EDR3 catalog. A list of the source positions on the focal plane and the ICRS coordinates is provided. The data tables are given in the [IPAC][IPAC] format. Solve the field center and the position angle. The answers are found as keywords in the meta section in the tables.

## Case 2
The data of the astrometry challenge Case-2: The telescope is set distortion-free. Astronomical sources are retrieved from the Gaia EDR3 catalog. A list of source positions on the focal plane is provided, while the corresponding stellar coordinates are not provided. Instead, a list of the coordinates is given as a separate file. The data tables are given in the [IPAC][IPAC] format. Solve the field center and the position angle. The answers are found as keywords in the meta section in the tables.

## Case 3
The data of the astrometry challenge Case 3: In this challenge, the telescope is affected by distortion. Artificial sources tiled in a grid pattern are generated. A list of source positions on the focal plane and original ICRS coordinates is provided. Solve the position angle and distortion parameters. The data tables are given in the [IPAC][IPAC] format. Solve the field and the distortion parameters. The answers are found as keywords in the meta section in the tables.

## Case 4
The data of the astrometry challenge Case 4: In this challenge, the telescope is affected by distortion. Astronomical sources are fetched from the Gaia EDR3 catalog. A list of source positions on the focal plane and original ICRS coordinates is provided. Solve the field and the distortion parameters. The data tables are given in the IPAC format. Solve the field center and the position angle. The answers are found as keywords in the meta section in the tables.
